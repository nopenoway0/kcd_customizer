## Summary
The goal of this program is to allow customization of the main character in Kingdom Come Deliverance. All modeling and rendering are done with the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) libary.

## Planned Features

* Pick any head for you character
* Easily swap and use custom textures for any chosen head
* Swap facial props between character heads

## Unlikely features

* add morph targets to each face, allow true customization (only if CryEngine modeling tools release)
